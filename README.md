🌍 Global Food Production Trends and Analysis (1961–2023)

📊 A Comprehensive Study Using Power BI

📘 Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global food production trends from 1961 to 2023. Leveraging Power BI, we visualized key            agricultural commodities to uncover insights into production   volumes, regional contributions, and long-term growth patterns. The study aims to       support strategic decision-making in the agricultural sector by highlighting critical trends and disparities in global food output.
